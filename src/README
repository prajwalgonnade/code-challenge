As a part of this code challenge, only ORDER event has been used to calculate the lifetime value.
This is because of the sample event data has been generated in such a way to include the total_amount only with ORDER event.

Future scope -
This script can be adapted to analyze other events and extract useful information other than a customer lifetime value
A Customer LTV can also include the quantifiable amount of site visits, time spent visiting the site, uploading data e.g. image, etc.
